## Description
I solved the problem 65 of leetcode named "Valid Number". The problem tell us that with a given string we have to return True if that string is a valid number, otherwise we have to return False.

A valid number is defined using one of the following descriptions:
- Integer number followed by an optional exponent
- Decimal number followed by an optional exponent
- An integer number can be defined by an optional sign (+/-) followed by digits (0/9)
- A deciaml number can be defined by an optional sign (+/-) followed by one of the followings definitions
  - Digits followed by a dot '.'
  - A dot '.' followed by digits
  - Digits followed by a dot '.' followed digits
- An exponent is defined with an exponent notation (e/E) followed by an integer number

This is quite useful because if we have a program that could identify if a given string is a number we can be sure that our program can work with that numbers, for example when you want to do a lot of tests but you are not sure that all the tests you give to your program are numbers you can use this.
